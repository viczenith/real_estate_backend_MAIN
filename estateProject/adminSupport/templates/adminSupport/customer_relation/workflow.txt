Your three primary goals are clear and already mapped to existing UI sections:

1. **Single/Bulk staff onboarding** – handled via the “Add Staff” form and CSV/Excel import modal.  
2. **Staff Directory** – the main table that should list all active staff.  
3. **Former Staff Directory** – the separate table that should capture off-boarded employees.

To make these features production-ready, we still need to wire the frontend to the live APIs you now have ([api_staff_list](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/HP/Documents/VictorGodwin/RE/MAIN/RealEstateMSApp/estateProject/adminSupport/views.py:1664:0-1680:42), [api_staff_import](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/HP/Documents/VictorGodwin/RE/MAIN/RealEstateMSApp/estateProject/adminSupport/views.py:1915:0-1993:95), [api_staff_remove](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/HP/Documents/VictorGodwin/RE/MAIN/RealEstateMSApp/estateProject/adminSupport/views.py:1875:0-1893:37), [api_staff_former](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/HP/Documents/VictorGodwin/RE/MAIN/RealEstateMSApp/estateProject/adminSupport/views.py:1683:0-1690:42), [api_staff_reactivate](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/HP/Documents/VictorGodwin/RE/MAIN/RealEstateMSApp/estateProject/adminSupport/views.py:1896:0-1912:37), etc.) so that the tables and actions reflect real database content rather than placeholder data.

### Suggested enhancements for comprehensive staff management (Nigerian context)

1. **Staff data completeness**
   - Capture Nigerian-specific identifiers: BVN, NIN, pension PIN, NHF number.
   - Support localization (African names, multiple phone numbers, +234 formatting).
   - Store next-of-kin details and emergency contacts.

2. **Onboarding & document management**
   - Upload offer letters, employment contracts, KYC documents (IDs, utility bills).
   - Track onboarding checklist (medical, background verification, equipment issuance).

3. **Attendance & leave**
   - Integrate time/attendance (manual input or biometric API).
   - Leave management with accrual rules compliant with Nigerian Labour Act (annual leave, maternity/paternity, sick leave).
   - Public holiday calendar for Nigeria.

4. **Performance & HR workflows**
   - Review cycles, KPI tracking, promotion history.
   - Issue and store warning letters or commendations.
   - Automate birthday/work-anniversary greetings using your outbound messaging.

5. **Payroll & compliance integrations**
   - Export/import staff data for payroll systems (Paystack Payroll, Bento, Sage, etc.).
  - Capture PAYE tax band, pension scheme, NHIS/NHA options.
   - Generate statutory reports (PENCOM schedules, tax remittance lists).

6. **Security & governance**
   - Role-based access control so HR, Admin, Support teams have appropriate rights.
   - Audit trail of staff profile changes and communications.
   - Offboarding workflow: clearance checklist, asset return, access revocation.

7. **Engagement & communications**
   - Segment messaging by department, location, role.
   - WhatsApp/SMS notification flows for critical announcements.
   - Internal surveys or pulse checks.

8. **Analytics & dashboards**
   - Headcount trend, attrition, gender diversity, tenure distribution.
   - Active vs inactive staff by branch or department.
   - Alerts for expiring documents (contracts, certifications).

Implementing these will give HR operations in a Nigerian company the coverage they expect while aligning with local regulatory requirements. Let me know which areas you’d like to prioritize next, and I’ll outline the concrete tasks.
