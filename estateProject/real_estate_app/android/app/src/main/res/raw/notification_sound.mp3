# This file serves as a placeholder for the notification sound.
# In a real implementation, you would place an actual MP3 file here.
# For now, this will use the system default notification sound.
# 
# To add a custom sound:
# 1. Get a short (1-3 second) MP3 file for notifications
# 2. Replace this file with the actual MP3
# 3. Ensure the file size is under 1MB for best performance
#
# WhatsApp-style notification sound characteristics:
# - Duration: 1-2 seconds
# - Format: MP3 or OGG
# - Frequency: Clear, attention-grabbing but not annoying
# - Volume: Moderate (will be adjusted by system volume)
